DMBS - Dean's Makefile Build System
===================================


Project Overview
----------------

GNU Make is scary, and it's tough to get the rules right sometimes. Many
projects get by via simple copy-pasting of old makefiles, resulting in many
redundant copies of the same old rules. DMBS aims to solve this by providing a
simple modular set of makefiles which can be included by your project to quickly
add various build functionality.

This aims to replace the old WinAVR "mfile" makefile template, giving better
functionality and much simpler user makefiles.
